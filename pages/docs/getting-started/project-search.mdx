# Project Search

Project search in Hashboard allows you to quickly locate and navigate to various resources within your project such as models, saved explorations, measures, metrics, and dashboards.

To initiate a search, you can use the search input located at the top of the side navigation bar. Simply type your query to see the results.

Alternatively, you can bring up the search dialog at any time by pressing `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows/Linux).

## Search Tips

- The search is not case-sensitive, meaning 'Sales' and 'sales' will return the same results.
- You can use partial names to find what youâ€™re looking for. For example, typing 'Rev' could show results for 'Revenue', 'Review', etc.
- Results will be ordered and grouped by the last time you accessed the resource.
- You can search your resources by name, description or grn
