# Security and Compliance

## SOC2 Type II Certification

<img src="/images/soc2.png" alt="SOC 2 Logo" style={{ maxWidth: "650px" }} />

Hashboard is SOC2 Type II certified. Developed by the AICPA, SOC 2 Type II is an extensive auditing procedure that ensures a company is handling customer data securely and in a manner that protects the organization as well as the privacy of its customers. SOC 2 is designed for service providers storing customer data in the cloud.

## HIPAA Compliant

With many members on our founding team coming from Flatiron Health, Hashboard has been built with extra consideration for healthcare organizations. We support Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance and also sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). There is no extra charge in Hashboard for HIPAA compliance or BAAs.

## Storing Data

Hashboard operates by issuing queries to user's existing data warehouses. We do not ingest and store the full underlying data of the tables.

To enable fast interactive data explorations, Hashboard caches aggregated query results within our infrastructure and in local browser sessions. Users can customize Hashboard’s [cache usage](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/data-modeling/caching) to meet specific performance or data freshness requirements.

## Row and Column Level Security

Hashboard offers a highly customizable security model that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your organization. Access to sensitive data can be limited to specific user roles at the database, table, row, or column level.
See our [permissions overview](../users-and-permissions/permissions-overview) documentation for more detail.
