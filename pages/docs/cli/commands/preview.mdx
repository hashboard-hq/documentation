# Preview

The preview command in Hashboard is a safe way to see what Hashboard configuration files will look like inside of Hashboard without affecting the state of the BI tool.  Pull makes forking and experimenting with Hashboard from the command line cheap and easy.  A preview goes through the following steps:

1. Validates local Hashboard configuration files and dbt configuration (if using `--dbt`)
2. Validates that the data warehouse schema is in sync with your data models
3. Creates a copy of your main project and puts it into a safe, containerized preview of your local changes and provides you a link to this forked version of your project
4. Provides you with a list of all managed resources that are changed‚Äîeither created, updated, deleted or unchanged

The `preview` command works with dbt and git workflows.
