# Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I display the top 10 values and an "Other" section?
1. From the Data Explorer, find the attribute you want to display the top 10 values for and [breakout by that attribute](/docs/visualizing-data/breakout#adding-and-removing-a-breakout).
2. In the control panel, toggle on [dynamic breakouts](/docs/visualizing-data/breakout#dynamic-breakouts) with **Dynamic** toggle.
3. Update the **Limit** to 10 with and ensure **Show Other** is checked.
4. Your changes should take effect immediately and you should see the top 10 values and an "Other" section.

### How do I import data from Excel / Google Sheets?

1. Export your Excel or Google Sheets data as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file.
2. Upload your CSV as a new data model by following [these steps](/docs/data-modeling/query-data-files).

### How do I add an image to a dashboard?
1. Open your dashboard in edit mode by navigating to the dashboard and clicking the **Edit** button.

2. Add a [Text](/docs/dashboards/text) block to your dashboard then click into the Text block you added.

3. Insert [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) for images utilizing the following syntax:

```
![alt text](<image URL> "image Title")
```

Replace `<image URL>` with your image's actual URL, and provide descriptive alt text and a title.

4. Save your changes with the **Save** button. After saving, your image will be displayed within the Text block.

### What to do when I get an "Unknown error" in DataOps?
There are several potential causes for DataOps errors.

#### Incorrect Configuration

In Hashboard, [Models](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/data-models), [Saved Explorations](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/saved-explorations), 
[dashboards](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/dashboards), and [color palettes](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/color-palettes) have their own configuration schemas.
When previewing or deploying builds, make sure that your configuration files contain all of the necessary fields. 

#### Invalid or Non-Unique Alias

If your resources have [aliases](/docs/data-ops/resource-identifiers), it's important to note that there are several criteria they must meet. 
Specifically, in order for a build to deploy successfully, aliases must:
- Be less than 120 characters in length.
- Consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores only.
- Be unique project-wide.

#### Resource References

In Hashboard, it is possible to have many resources that reference each other in different ways. 
These references can be broken by deleting resources, updating aliases, or changing names of database connections, to name a few examples.
When updating or deleting a resource, be mindful of the possible consequences that can occur downstream its resource lineage.

#### dbt errors

When running a build with a model from dbt, make sure that the dbt project file contains the correct [Hashboard meta fields](/docs/data-ops/dbt-integration). 
In addition, the --dbt flag must be used when running `hb preview` or `hb deploy` in order for dbt models to be included in the build.
