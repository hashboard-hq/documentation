# dbt Workflows

## Overview

Hashboard can import models directly from dbt by specifying measures in your dbt yaml file. Hashboard will automatically sync dbt documentation and keep measures in sync with downstream dashboards (whether they are checked into version control or not). The Hashboard dbt integration can also be integrated in CI/CD workflows.

<Steps>

### Configure your `.hbproject` file

If you have not already, configure the root of your Hashboard project and your dbt project with [`hb init`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/init).

Set the `dbtRoot` key in your Hashboard project file using [`hb init --dbt-root=path/to/dbt/project`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/init) or manually editing the `.hbproject` file if it already exists.

```yaml filename="example .hbproject file" copy
# This file marks the root of your Hashboard project directory. It determines
# the identity of the resources in your local filesystem
# and encodes additional project configuration metadata.
# For additional information please visit docs.hashboard.com.
dbtRoot: ./dbt/
```

### Configure your `dbt_project.yml`

You can use the `hashboard-defaults` key to specify the hashboard version and the data connection to use.

```yaml filename="dbt_project.yml" copy
models:
  +meta:
    # hashboard-defaults settings will be merged into each Hashboard model
    hashboard-defaults:
      hbVersion: "1.0"
      connectionName: # which Hashboard data connection to use
```

### Define model information

The simplest example of a Hashboard model just defines a measure. Hashboard models must include the `hashboard` key in the dbt model meta.

```yaml filename="models/schema.yml" copy
version: 2

models:
  #
  - name: order_attribution
    description: This model describes how each order is attributed to different marketing touchpoints.
    columns:
      - name: attribution_id
        description: Unique ID for the attribution.
      - name: order_id
        description: Order ID, matches the order_id in the sales model.
      - name: touchpoint_id
        description: ID of the marketing touchpoint which led to the order.
    meta:
      hashboard:
        cols:
          - id: row_count
            type: measure
            name: Order Attribution Records
            aggregate: row_count
```

### Build your Hashboard models

Assuming you've set the `dbtRoot` flag with [`hb init`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/init), you can simply run [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/build) and Hashboard will automatically include your dbt-specified Hashboard models.

```bash copy
hb build
```

## Slim CI: Defer schema with dbt Cloud or Core

The Hashboard dbt integrations support `Defer` for both dbt Core and Cloud when running a build, also commonly referred to as "Slim CI".

  Core](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/defer) or [dbt Defer in
  Cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/about-cloud-develop-defer) can speed
  up development and reduce costs.
</Callout>

### Setup for database deferrals

To enable database deferrals update your `.hbproject` file to include a dbtOptions key with the following configuration:

```yaml filename="example .hbproject file" copy
# This file marks the root of your Hashboard project directory. It determines
# the identity of the resources in your local filesystem
# and encodes additional project configuration metadata.
# For additional information please visit docs.hashboard.com.
dbtRoot: ./dbt/
dbtOptions:
  useDefer: true
```

If you're deferring across databases and not just schemas you must also set the `includeDbNameInSchema` value so that Hashboard fully qualifies the tables being referenced by your models. Also ensure that the data source connection you have configured for your dbt models has access to both production and development databases.

```yaml filename="example .hbproject file" copy
# This file marks the root of your Hashboard project directory. It determines
# the identity of the resources in your local filesystem
# and encodes additional project configuration metadata.
# For additional information please visit docs.hashboard.com.
dbtRoot: ./dbt/
dbtOptions:
  useDefer: true
  includeDbNameInSchema: true
```

### dbt Core

When using dbt Core, you can use the `--dbt-state` flag to pass a state for deferral.

```bash copy
hb build --dbt-state=target_prod/
```

### dbt Cloud

With dbt Cloud, the Hashboard CLI will infer deferred schemas without any additional flags. You can simply run [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/build) once you've configured your [Hashboard project file](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/init).

```bash copy
hb build
```

### What happens when I run [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/build)?

1.  For each Hashboard model in the manifest, we run `dbt compile`, which returns a fully qualified reference to where the model would be built in the warehouse, including the deferred schema.
2.  We use the `dbt compile` results to set the schemas for the Hashboard models in the build.
3.  We run `dbt parse` to generate the `manifest.json`, which contains the Hashboard model definitions.

## Building a subset of models with `dbt:` args

By default, `hb build` will create a Hashboard build that includes all of the Hashboard models specified in dbt as well as any other Hashboard resources present in the working directory.

If you only want to build a subset of the models, you can use [dbt's `select` syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax) prefixed by `dbt:` .

For example, if you only wanted to build modified dbt models, you could run

```bash copy
hb build dbt:modified
```

If you only wanted to build dbt models without rebuilding resources defined in Hashboard yaml files you could run

```bash copy
hb build dbt:all
```

## Model specification

The `hashboard-defaults` connection configuration in the example above gets merged into the Hashboard configuration inside each dbt model. If you don't specify the defaults, you must add the complete connection information in the `meta` key of each dbt model you want imported to Hashboard. Only dbt models that specify a `hashboard` key will get built into Hashboard models.

```yaml filename="schema.yml" copy
version: 2

models:
  - name: a_model
    description: model docs here
    meta:
      hashboard:
        hbVersion: "1.0" # Hashboard dbt integration version
        source:
          connectionName: snowflake_production # which Hashboard data connection to use, can also be specified globally if you use hashboard-defaults
    columns:
      - name: a_str
        description: some column documentation
      # ... your dbt columns
```

Some notes on how models get built from dbt:

- Hashboard will read the dbt manifest file and find all models with a `hashboard` key specified within the `meta` key.
- The name of dbt model is imported into Hashboard as the model name (this can be overriden).
- Columns specified explicitly in the dbt model will become attributes in Hashboard.
- Descriptions on the model will get imported as model documentation.
- You can specify additional attribute configuration in a `meta` key for a column.

How data model source is determined:

- `source` has the same options as the corresponding field of [Hashboard data models](./config-schema/data-models.mdx).
- Unless otherwise specified, Hashboard automatically infers defaults for the source `physicalName` and `schema`. If no `connectionName` or `connectionId` is specified, Hashboard will try to use a connection whose name is the same as the dbt target database (e.g. `"bigquery"` or `"snowflake"`).

Hashboard will include each dbt column as an attribute in the corresponding Hashboard model. You can also add additional fields to the dbt columns to take advantage of Hashboard's more advanced modeling features:

```yaml
# ... as above
columns:
  - name: my_dbt_attribute
    documentation: this is a dbt attribute
    tests:
      - unique
      - not_null
    # add additional configuration to this column
    meta:
      hashboard:
        primaryKey: true
```

To add Hashboard measures (or other attributes not present in the dbt model) to the imported model, you can add a `cols` field to the dbt model's `meta.hashboard` configuration:

```yaml
models:
  - # ... dbt schema configuration, as above
    meta:
      hashboard:
        cols:
          - id: daily_active_users
            type: measure
            name: Daily Active Users
            sql: COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT create_at)
```

Hashboard configuration in your dbt schema file has access to the same [templating and macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros) as your dbt configuration. You could, for example, configure the Hashboard data connection based on your dbt target:

```yaml
models:
  - # ... dbt model configuration
    meta:
      hashboard:
        hbVersion: "1.0"
        name: "customers"
        source:
          # configure the source based on the dbt target
          connectionName: "{{ target.database }}"
```

Column descriptions will be [automatically synced](../data-modeling/description-syncing.mdx) from dbt to the corresponding Hashboard model during deploys.

## Global configuration

If all models use the same Hashboard `source`, you can configure a default `source` in the `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yaml filename="dbt_project.yml"
models:
  the_models:
    +meta: # will be applied to every model in models/the_models
      hashboard-defaults:
        source:
          connectionName: # which Hashboard data connection to use
```

To import all dbt models in a folder as Hashboard models, simply add

```yaml filename="dbt_project.yml"
models:
  folder:
    +meta:
      hashboard:
        hbVersion: "1.0"
        source:
          connectionName: # which Hashboard data connection to use
```

This configuration will add the `meta.hashboard` object to every model in `folder`, so they will all be imported into Hashboard. You can still add additional metadata for the specific models (such as adding additional metrics).
