# Managing Resources With Code

## Code management lifecycle

Managing resources with code in Hashboard follows this lifecycle:

1. You create a **build** that bundles together proposed changes to your resources
2. Hashboard **validates** that your changes will not break anything in your project.
3. You and/or the relevant reviewers **preview** the changes in your build to ensure they are having the intended impact.
4. Your build is **applied** to your project, which deploys your changes to your users.

Below is more detail on each of these steps of the process.

### Creating a build

Create a Hashboard build by defining one or more Hashboard yml [configuration files](#hashboard-configuration-files) in your filesystem and passing them into the [`hb build`](./cli/build) command.

Hashboard builds automatically propagate any changes necessary to keep your project consistent. This includes:

- **Updating downstream resources.** If a column is changed, it will be updated in all dependent items (regardless of whether the dependent items are part of your build) - so changes like name updates will be correctly reflected everywhere.
- **Cleaning up defunct resources.** If any Models, Attributes, or Measures are deleted, all dependent items that relied on that Model or Column will also be deleted.

### Build validation

Here is a high-level description of what actually happens during the build process:

- **Smoke test.** Once the model is built, a single aggregate analytical query will be run against the database to make sure that data aggregation can still be run against the model.

If there is an error while deploying a Data Model, the build process will revert to the previous version of that model, and all dependent resources of that model will not be updated.

### Previewing a build

### Applying a build

## Hashboard configuration files

Hashboard supports configuration files written in YAML or JSON. A Hashboard Build will attempt to validate every file in the specified path with a `.yml` or `.json` extension.

Full documentation of all configuration files can be found for each resource type:

- [Data Models](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/Data-Model)
- [Saved Explorations](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/saved-explorations)
- [Dashboards](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/Dashboard)
- [Color Palettes](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/Color-Palette)
- [Homepage Launchpad](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/Homepage-Launchpad)

<Callout type="info">
  To export configuration files, use the [`pull`](/docs/data-ops/cli/pull)
  command.
</Callout>

### Migrating existing resources to code

If you have existing content built in the UI and want to move it into code,
you can specify the `grn` property on the resource. This will cause the config to
update an existing resource with that [GRN](/docs/data-ops/resource-identifiers), instead of creating a
new resource.

This can also be used to avoid recreating resources when renaming or refactoring
the file structure of your project.

### Code managed resources

To protect specific resources to only be editable with the Hashboard deployments, add the `preventUpdatesFromUI` flag set as `true` to any config. This prevents users from unintentionally updating critical resources from the Hashboard web application and gives your team greater control over valuable long lived resources that are core to your business needs.

### Syncing resources

To sync your local config files with edits made to resources via the UI, use the [`pull`](/docs/data-ops/cli/pull) command.
