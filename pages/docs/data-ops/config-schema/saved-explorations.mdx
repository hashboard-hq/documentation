# Saved Explorations

<Callout type="warning">
  Hashboard previously used the term **saved view** to refer to what is now called a **saved exploration**. 
  At the moment our configuration files still refer to `type: saved_view` when creating saved explorations. 
  We plan to update the schema of these configuration files in the future.
