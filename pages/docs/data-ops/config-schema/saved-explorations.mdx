# Saved Explorations

<Callout type="warning">
  Hashboard previously used the term **saved views** to refer to what are now
  called **saved explorations**. At the moment our configuration files still
  refer to `type: saved_view` when defining saved explorations. We plan to
  update the schema of these configuration files in the future to use the term
  **saved explorations** instead of **saved views**.
