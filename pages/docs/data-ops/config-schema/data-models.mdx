# Data Models

<Callout type="warning">
  Hashboard previously used the term **metric** to refer to what is now called a
  **measure**. At the moment our configuration files still refer to `type:
  metric` when creating measures inside a data model. We plan to update the
  schema of these configuration files in the future to use the term **measure**
  instead of **metric**.
