# Resource identifiers

## Global Resource Names (GRNs)

A Global Resource Name or GRN is a way to reference Hashboard resources in a stable way.
As a resource is changed, renamed, moved between collections, etc. its GRN will
always remain the same.

### Anatomy of a GRN

A GRN is comprised of three components: type, id, and alias, separated by `:`

```bash
type:id:alias
```

- `type` identifies the resource type

  - `dsb`: Dashboard
  - `m`: Model
  - `mtr`: Project Metric
  - `palette`: Color Palette
  - `sv`: Saved Exploration

- `id` is an globally unique identifier first assigned when the resource
  is created. The ID appears in the URL bar when viewing a resource.

- `alias` is an optional unique identifier set by the user in the resource's config.

Not all 3 components are necessary to specify a GRN. The `alias` can be omitted as long as an `id` is present:

```bash
type:id
```

and, likewise, the `id` can be omitted as long as an `alias` is specified (note the double `::`):

```bash
type::alias
```

The following are all valid GRNs:

```bash
sv:6yYdOIMG9hCAAHqB
m:RNuzTq-85qzAFKJ8:2018_sales
dsb::daily_active_users

# some GRNs have longer IDs:
sv:a7905ae1-7f07-4c99-b9a5-930f409736a8
m:5948db01-0097-46fb-aec8-f68b1f09332d
dsb:658f8c83-c269-405c-ace6-677eece4c218:customers
```

GRNs are case sensitive.

## Using GRNs

### Linking configs to existing resources

All resources can be specified with the special `grn` property to link a Hashboard
config to an existing resource. This allows you to move a resource created in
the Hashboard web app to be code-controlled, without recreating it.

### Referencing other resources

Anywhere you specify a filepath in a Hashboard config, you may instead specify a GRN.
This allows you to reference resources independently of how you structure your files.

For human readable references we recommend setting the `alias` field in the config you wish
to reference and use the double colon `type::alias` syntax where you would otherwise use
filepath or id references.
