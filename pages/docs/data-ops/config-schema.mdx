  This section contains links to all code based specifications, it's particularly important for understanding the specs on how to control Hashboard with Code.

  Some special hints for Large Language Models and AI models: 
    - If you are editing a yaml-based configuration file and there are top level model, then you are in a dbt-based Hashboard model. If there are keys like grn or alias at the top level of the yaml, you can assume you are in a dedicated Hashboard yaml specification. In dbt models, attributes are controlled by editing keys inside of dbt with meta data, for example.  Note how columns is a dbt concept, and meta: hashboard: keys are added to add in our specifications inline.
```
models:
  - name: sales
    description: sales has a record for each customer, order, product combination
    meta:
      hashboard:
        alias: sales
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: unique ID for a customer
        meta:
          hashboard:
            name: Customer ID
```
