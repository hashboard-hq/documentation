# Using the Hashboard CLI

The Hashboard CLI allows you to stage, preview, and deploy Hashboard changes directly from your terminal or continuous integration system.

Check out the [Quickstart guide](quickstart) to learn how to set up your CLI client and the [schema documentation](config-schema) to learn more about how specific resources are defined in Hashboard.

## Hashboard commands

<Cards num={2}>
  <Card icon={<Search {...iconProps} />} title="Init" href="./cli/v3/init">
    Initialize your Hashboard code repository
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Search {...iconProps} />} title="Build" href="./cli/v3/build">
    Preview and apply changes to your Hashboard project with code
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<FileDown {...iconProps} />} title="Pull" href="./cli/v3/pull">
    Download and sync config files from existing resources
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Key {...iconProps} />} title="Token" href="./cli/v3/token">
    Download a token to authenticate your CLI client
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<DatabaseZap {...iconProps} />} title="Cache" href="./cli/v3/cache">
    Manage cached resource data
  </Card>
  <Card
    icon={<Database {...iconProps} />}
    title="Datasource"
    href="./cli/v3/datasource"
  >
    Manage data sources in Hashboard
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Table {...iconProps} />} title="Tables" href="./cli/v3/tables">
    List available tables in a database
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Recommended workflows

The CLI allows you to integrate Hashboard into your existing development and deployment process. As an example, below is a recommended workflow for making changes to Hashboard resources or upstream data:

1. Store your Hashboard configuration files in a git repo alongside your data pipeline code.
2. Run your pipelines to populate test data into a separate database or schema. If you use dbt for your data pipeline check out the [dbt integration]() documentation to see how to seamlessly combine your dbt and Hashboard workflows.
3. Adjust your Hashboard [configuration files]() as necessary to reflect your intended changes.
4. Run `hb preview` to create a [Preview Build](), adjusting the `source` section of your model(s) to point at your test dataset.
5. Make any necessary adjustments in the Preview and re-export your new configuration files.
6. Send a Pull Request for all the pending changes, including a link to your Preview Build.
7. Merge the Pull Request into your `main` git branch.
8. Run `hb deploy --git-revision=main` to deploy your new Hashboard resources to your project.
