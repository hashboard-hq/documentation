# Using the Hashboard CLI

The Hashboard CLI allows you to create Preview and Deploy Builds directly from your terminal or continuous integration system.

## Recommended workflows

The CLI allows you to integrate Hashboard into your existing development and deployment process. As an example, here is a typical workflow that we use when making changes to Hashboard resources or upstream data:

1. Store your Hashboard configuration files in a git repo alongside your data pipeline code.
2. Run your pipelines to populate test data into a separate database or schema.
3. Adjust your Hashboard configuration files as necessary to reflect your intended changes.
4. Run `hb preview` to create a Preview Build, adjusting the `source` section of your model(s) to point at your test dataset.
5. Make any necessary adjustments in the Preview and re-export your new configuration files.
6. Send a Pull Request for all the pending changes, including a link to your Preview Build.
7. Merge the Pull Request into your `main` git branch.
8. Run `hb deploy --git-revision=main` to deploy your new Hashboard resources to your project.
