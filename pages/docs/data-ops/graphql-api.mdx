# GraphQL API

Hashboard publishes a public GraphQL API that you can use to programatically fetch project resources.

## Authentication

Requests to the GraphQL API are authenticated with an API token. An API token is tied to a user in Hashboard and inherits all of that user's permissions.

To generate a new API token:

1. Go to your [Project Settings page](https://hashboard.com/app/p/settings)
2. Click `Access Keys` on the left side navigation
3. Click `+ New Access Key`
4. Write a descriptive name for the API token, select `API token` as the Type, and click `Create`

The resulting screen will provide you with your API token. Save this in a safe place, as it cannot be re-created once you navigate away.

When making requests to the public GraphQL API, set the `Authorization` header key to your API token.

API tokens expire after 1 year.

## Schema

The current public GraphQL schema is below and can also be inspected with [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/).

Currently, the public GraphQL API supports fetching metadata on Projects, Models, Saved Explorations, Metrics, Dashboards, Users and Roles.

[Contact us](mailto:support@hashboard.com) if you are interested in accessing additional Hashboard resources via the public GraphQL API.
