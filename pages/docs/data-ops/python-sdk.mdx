# Python SDK (Hashquery)

Hashboard has a Python SDK called [Hashquery](https://hashquery.dev/). Hashquery is a semantic layer API, modeling language, and querying tool, all in one.

You can use Hashquery to:

- Query the data defined by your models and metrics in other applications, anywhere you can run Python.
- Layer more complex business logic on top of your core models, including complex conditionals, recursive joins, and sequence analyses.
- Build rich, interactive applications on top of your Hashboard-governed data models using frameworks like [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

More more details about Hashquery, check out its [overview page](https://hashquery.dev/) and [documentation](https://hashquery.dev/docs).
