# CLI Quickstart

The Hashboard CLI lets you build your Hashboard resources from configuration files, with [preview](./commands/preview) builds and [deployments](./commands/deploy).  Check out [example projects on github](https://github.com/hashboard-hq/examples).

<Steps>
### Install the Hashboard cli

```bash copy
pip install hashboard-cli
```

### Signup and auth

First signup for an account by clicking 'get access' on [hashboard.com](https://hashboard.com) or you can signup and authenticate with a single command:

```bash copy filename="signup and auth via cli"
hb signup
```

The `token` command will take you through a web-based auth flow and download your access token to the default token location at ~/.hashboard/hb_access_key.json - you can also specify the token location with the environment variable `HASHBOARD_CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH`.

```bash filename="if you signed up on the web" copy
hb token
```

### Pull resources
You can now test that things are working properly, a pull command is a good one to test:
```bash copy
hb pull
```
</Steps>
