# CLI Quickstart

The Hashboard CLI lets you build your Hashboard resources from configuration files, with preview builds and deployments.

<Steps>
### Install the Hashboard CLI

```bash copy
pip install hashboard-cli
```

### Sign up or log in

#### New users

You can sign up for a new Hashboard account with a single command:

```bash copy
hb signup
```

Alternatively, click <strong>Get started</strong> on [hashboard.com](https://hashboard.com) to create an account through our website.

#### Existing users

The `token` command will take you through a web-based authentication flow and download a new access key for you. This will be stored at
the default filepath `~/.hashboard/hb_access_key.json`.

```bash copy
hb token
```

For information about how to store this token at a different filepath, see the [`token`](/docs/data-ops/cli/token) documentation.

### Set up integrations

Hashboard integrates seamlessly with other tools so you can easily manage your data and dashboards with a single workflow. Read our documentation on how to set up integrations for [dbt](./dbt-integration) and [Git](./git-integration) to connect Hashboard to your data pipeline.

### Pull resources or build a sample project

If you've created data models, saved explorations or dashboards via the Hashboard GUI you can get started iterating on those resources as code using the [`pull`](./cli/pull) command. `hb pull --all` will pull the configs of all resources in your project into your current directory.

```bash copy
hb pull --all
```

To get started with sample data, check out our [example projects on GitHub](https://github.com/hashboard-hq/examples).

### Edit resources

You can now edit your resources as code and check them into Git for version control. Visit the [schema reference](./config-schema) to learn about how to define Hashboard resource configurations.

### Deploy your changes

Use the [`deploy`](./cli/deploy) command to write your changes back to your Hashboard project. By default you'll be able to [`preview`](./cli/preview) your changes before they're published.

```bash copy
hb deploy
```
