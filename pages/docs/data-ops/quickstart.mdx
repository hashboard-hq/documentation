# CLI Quickstart

The Hashboard CLI lets you build your Hashboard resources from configuration files, with preview builds and deployments.

<Steps>
### Install the Hashboard cli

```bash copy
pip install hashboard-cli
```

### Signup and auth

First signup for an account by clicking 'Get started' on [hashboard.com](https://hashboard.com) or you can signup and authenticate with a single command:

```bash copy filename="signup and auth via cli"
hb signup
```

The `token` command will take you through a web-based auth flow and download your access token to the default token location at ~/.hashboard/hb_access_key.json - you can also specify the token location with the environment variable `HASHBOARD_CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH`.

```bash filename="if you signed up on the web" copy
hb token
```

### Set up integrations

Hashboard integrates seamlessly with other tools so you can easily manage your data and your dashboards in a single workflow. Read our documentation on how to set up integrations for [dbt](./dbt-integration) and [Git](./git-integration) to connect Hashboard with your data pipeline.

### Pull resources or build a sample project

If you've created data models, saved explorations or dashboards via the Hashboard GUI you can get started iterating on those resources as code using the [pull command](./cli/pull). `hb pull --all` will write the configs of all the resources in your project to your current directory.

```bash copy
hb pull --all
```

To get started with sample data check out our [example projects on github](https://github.com/hashboard-hq/examples).

### Edit resources

You can now edit your resources as code and check them into git for version control. Visit the [schema reference](./config-schema) to learn about how to define Hashboard resource configurations.

### Deploy your changes

Use the [deploy command](./cli/deploy) to write your changes back to your Hashboard project. By default you'll be able to [preview](./cli/preview) your changes before they're published.

```bash copy
hb deploy
```
