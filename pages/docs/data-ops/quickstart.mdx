# CLI Quickstart

The Hashboard CLI lets you build your Hashboard resources from configuration files, with preview builds and deployments.

<Steps>
### Install the Hashboard CLI

```bash copy
pip install hashboard-cli
```

### Create a Hashboard project, if necessary

If you are a new Hashboard user, go to [hashboard.com/getAccess](https://hashboard.com/getAccess) to create an account.

### Authenticate your CLI client

The `token` command will take you through a web-based authentication flow and download a new access key for you. This will be stored at
the default filepath `~/.hashboard/hb_access_key.json`.

```bash copy
hb token
```

For information about how to store this token at a different filepath, see the [`token`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/token) documentation.

### Connect your data sources

Use the Hashboard UI to configure your [database connection](/docs/database-connections).

### Initialize your Hashboard codebase
This command creates your `.hbproject` file, which contains CLI configuration options. Run this  wherever you would like the root of your Hashboard files to be.
```bash copy
hb init
```

### Pull resources or build a sample project

If you've created data models, saved explorations or dashboards via the Hashboard GUI, you can get started iterating on those resources as code using the [`pull`](./cli/v3/pull) command. `hb pull --all` will pull the configs of all resources in your project into your current directory.

```bash copy
hb pull --all
```

To get started with sample data, check out our [example projects on GitHub](https://github.com/hashboard-hq/examples).

To bootstrap your Hashboard project with dbt models, see the documentation for our [dbt Integration](./dbt-integration).

### Edit resources

You can now edit your resources as code and check them into Git for version control. Visit the [schema reference](./config-schema) to learn about how to define Hashboard resource configurations.

### Preview your changes

Create a build containing the changes you've staged. You'll be able to preview your changes and share it for review before applying them to your project.

```bash copy
hb build
```

### Apply your changes

Once everything looks good, apply your build, which merges the staged changes into your project.
```bash copy

hb build apply
```
