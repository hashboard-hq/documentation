## Continuous integration

Hashboard can serve to run continuous integration on your Business Intelligence dashboards, this can be integrated with git and dbt workflows in Glean.  You can invoke the Hashboard CLI in a continuous integration system to automatically generate previews or deploy your project.

For example, if you use GitHub, the following GitHub action will generate a Build Preview of the local `hashboard` directory whenever you send a pull request:

```yaml
name: hashboard-preview
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  create-hashboard-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: pip install hashboard-cli
      - run: cd hashboard && hb preview
    env:
      HASHBOARD_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.HASHBOARD_PROJECT_ID_PROD }}
      HASHBOARD_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.HASHBOARD_ACCESS_KEY_ID_PROD }}
      HASHBOARD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HASHBOARD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_TOKEN_PROD }}
```
