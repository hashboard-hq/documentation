# Hashboard `build` command

The `build` command is the primary command you can use to create, update, and delete Hashboard resources using code.

A Hashboard build is a collection of changes that you've defined as code and can be validated, previewed, and applied to your project. Builds make forking and
experimenting with Hashboard from the command line cheap and easy.

When you create a build, Hashboard will do the following:

1. Validate your Hashboard configuration files and dbt configuration (if using the dbt integration)
2. Validate that any models in the build are compatible with their underlying data sources
3. Provide you with a link to the build summary, where you can see details of the proposed changes, preview them, and apply them to your project

## Creating a build and previewing changes

<Steps>
### Run `hb init`

If you have not already, configure the root of your Hashboard project (and optionally your dbt project) with [`hb init`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/init).

### Create a build

Run `hb build`, or equivalently `hb build create`.

```bash copy
hb build
```

This evaluates all files in your current directory, any nested directories, and your dbt models (if you've setup).

Check and apply these changes at the link or use `hb build apply`.
```

You can scope your build to specific resources by providing a list of filepath globs or dbt selectors to the `build` command.

```bash copy
hb build path/to/hashboard-files/* dbt:modified
```

### View the build

Go to the build link at the bottom of the build details. The build page displays a list of the built resources with live preview links and code diffs.

### Apply the build: `hb build apply`

Run `hb build apply` to apply the build you last created. You will shown the details of the last build you created and be asked to confirm.

```bash copy
hb build apply
```

Confirm and apply these changes to your project? [y/n]: y
```

Once you confirm, the build will be applied and the CLI will show an applied badge.
