# Hashboard `build` command

The `build` command is the primary command you can use to create, update, and delete Hashboard resources using code.

A Hashboard build is a collection of changes that you've defined as code and can be validated, previewed, and applied to your project. Builds make forking and
experimenting with Hashboard from the command line cheap and easy.

When you create a build, Hashboard will do the following:

1. Validate your Hashboard configuration files and dbt configuration (if using the dbt integration)
2. Validate that any models in the build are compatible with their underlying data sources
3. Provide you with a link to the build summary, where you can see details of the proposed changes, preview them, and apply them to your project

## Creating a build and previewing changes

<Steps>
### run `hb preview`

```bash {30}
# from the root of your dbt directory
$ hb preview --dbt

üêá Running `dbt parse` to generate a manifest file.

### Navigate resource previews

Click any resource to open the preview and start to explore. The build is added as a URL query parameter so you can share links (or put them in pull requests, for example). You can navigate through your entire project in the preview mode.
