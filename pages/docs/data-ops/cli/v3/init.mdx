# Hashboard `init` command

The `init` command initializes the root of your Hashboard project by creating a `.hbproject` file in the directory where it is run.

## Stable References for YAML Files

In cases where a Hashboard YAML file does not have a GRN (Global Resource Name), the relative path from the `.hbproject` file to the YAML file is used as a stable reference. This ensures a consistent reference to the YAML file, regardless of where [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/build) commands are executed.

Once the `hb init` command has created the `.hbproject` file, [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/build) commands can be safely run in the same directory as the `.hbproject` file or any of its subdirectories.

<Callout type="info">
  Starting out, we recommend the following project structure with the `.hbproject` file at the root of your repo and two separate directories for your Hashboard and dbt files.

```
├── .hbproject
└── hashboard
  ├── model.yaml
  └── dashboard.yaml
└── dbt
  └── dbt_project.yml
```

</Callout>

## Configuring Hashboard's dbt Integration

The `.hbproject` file can store configuration for Hashboard's dbt integration using the `dbtRoot` key. This key specifies the path to the root directory of your dbt project.

There are two ways to set the `dbtRoot` value:

1. Pass the path to your dbt project root when running the `hb init` command: `hb init --dbt-root /path/to/your/dbt/project/root`
2. Manually edit the `.hbproject` file and modify the dbtRoot key

By setting the `dbtRoot` value, Hashboard run the dbt integration during [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/build) by default.

## The .hbproject file

Below are all the options that can be defined within the .hbproject file. Any value under dbtOptions can also be set using the corresponding environment variable.

| .hbproject key                    | env variable                | usage                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dbtRoot                           |                             | Path to the root directory of your dbt project                                                                                              |
| dbtOptions: useDefer              | HB_DBT_USE_DEFER            | "True" or "False" value indicating if Hashboard should look for tables deferred to production in dbt.                                       |
| dbtOptions: includeDbNameInSchema | HB_DBT_INCLUDE_DB_IN_SCHEMA | "True" or "False" value indicating if schemas should be qualified with a database name, primarily used when doing cross database deferrals. |
| dbtOptions: accountId             | HB_DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID     | The dbt Cloud account id to use when fetching a specific run if creating a build with the --dbt-cloud-run-id flag                           |

### Example

```
dbtRoot: path/to/folder
dbtOptions:
  useDefer: True
  includeDbNameInSchema: False
  accountId: dbt-cloud-account-id
```
