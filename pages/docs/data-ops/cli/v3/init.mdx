# Hashboard `init` command

The `init` command initializes the root of your Hashboard project by creating a `.hbproject` file in the directory where it is run.

## Stable References for YAML Files

In cases where a Hashboard YAML file does not have a GRN (Global Resource Name), the relative path from the `.hbproject` file to the YAML file is used as a stable reference. This ensures a consistent reference to the YAML file, regardless of where [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/build) commands are executed.

Once the `hb init` command has created the `.hbproject` file, [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/build) commands can be safely run in the same directory as the `.hbproject` file or any of its subdirectories.

<Callout type="info">
  Starting out, we recommend the following project structure with the `.hbproject` file at the root of your repo and two separate directories for your Hashboard and dbt files.
  
  ```
  ├── .hbproject
  └── hashboard
    ├── model.yaml
    └── dashboard.yaml
  └── dbt
    └── dbt_project.yml
  ```
</Callout>

## Configuring Hashboard's dbt Integration

The `.hbproject` file can store configuration for Hashboard's dbt integration using the `dbt_root` key. This key specifies the path to the root directory of your dbt project.

There are two ways to set the `dbt_root` value:

1. Pass the path to your dbt project root when running the `hb init` command: `hb init --dbt-root /path/to/your/dbt/project/root`
2. Manually edit the `.hbproject` file and modify the dbt_root key

By setting the `dbt_root` value, Hashboard run the dbt integration during [`hb build`](/docs/data-ops/cli/v3/build) by default.
