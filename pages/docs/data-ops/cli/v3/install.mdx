# Install the latest pre-release version of the Hashboard CLI

<Steps>

### Uninstall any existing version of `hashboard-cli`

If you've already install the CLI, this is required before installing the pre-release version.

```bash copy
pip uninstall hashboard-cli
```

### pip install with `--pre` flag

The `--pre` flag will include pre-release and development versions. By default, pip only finds stable versions.

```bash copy
pip install --pre hashboard-cli
```

### Next: run `hb init`
