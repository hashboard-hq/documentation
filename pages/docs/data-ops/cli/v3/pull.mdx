# Hashboard `pull` command

The `pull` command is a utility for getting resource configuration files from the web UI to a local workspace. You can use it to migrate resources to a code-based workflow. If you already have local files that correspond with Hashboard resources, `hb pull` will update the local versions of those files.

## Updating resources and dev workflow

The default behavior of `pull` is to only update resources that were created through the Hashboard CLI (i.e. any `hb` command).

For example: let's say you originally built four models with the CLI and another two models in the UI. If you run `hb pull` from an empty directory, you'll only pull those four model files. You won't get the two UI-built models, or any additional resources built in the UI for that matter.

## `pull` resources originally built in the UI

You can also pull resources that were not built with the CLI. If you want to pull down a resource that was built in the UI, you have two options:

### 1. Pull all resources

You can use the `--all` flag to get every single Hashboard resource regardless of whether it was created with the CLI.

```bash copy
hb pull --all
```

### 2. Pull a specific resource with a GRN

You can pull down a specific resource by its [Global Resource Name](/docs/data-ops/resource-identifiers).

```bash
# pull by a specific grn
hb pull m:s3AdinvBhsdJ:

# alternatively, pull by alias
hb pull m::my_sales_model
```

## Config format used in `pull`

`hb pull` uses the most verbose (and specific) possible format of a resource. Some configuration that is just defaulted or configured by Hashboard will be exported.

For example: if you export a resource, it will default to being exported with a `pinned` [GRN](/docs/data-ops/resource-identifiers). You can remove the GRN to enable deploying the resource across different projects (or use an alias so that the resource is not bound to a specific instance in a single project).

## dbt models and the `pull` command

Currently, the Hashboard CLI does not automatically update Hashboard metadata inside of dbt files, so any dbt-based models are skipped when evaluating the `pull` command.
