# Credentials

The CLI is authenticated by an access key. To create a new access key, run the [`token`](/docs/data-ops/cli/token) command or go to 
your [`Settings`](https://hashboard.com/app/p/settings#access_keys) in the web UI.

By default, the CLI looks for your access key in `~/.hashboard/hb_access_key.json`. To use a different filepath, you can either:

- Set the `HASHBOARD_CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH` environment variable.
```bash copy
export HASHBOARD_CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH=your/absolute/filepath
# All commands will now use the above credentials filepath.
hb preview
```

- Use the `--credentials-filepath` command-line option on a per-command basis.
```bash copy
# Uses the given filepath while running this command.
hb --credentials-filepath your/absolute/filepath preview
```

- Set the `HASHBOARD_PROJECT_ID`, `HASHBOARD_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `HASHBOARD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_TOKEN` environment variables to the respective values stored in your access key file.
```bash copy
export HASHBOARD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
export HASHBOARD_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
export HASHBOARD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_TOKEN=your_secret_access_key_token
# All commands will now use the above credentials.
hb preview
```
