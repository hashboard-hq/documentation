# Hashboard `pull` command

The `pull` command is a utility for getting resource configuration files from the web UI to a local workspace. You can use it to migrate resources to a code-based workflow. If you already have local files that correspond with Hashboard resources, `hb pull` will update the local versions of those files.

## Updating resources and dev workflow

The default behavior of `pull` is to only update resources that were created through the Hashboard CLI (i.e. any `hb` command).

For example: let's say you originally built four models with the CLI and another two models in the UI. If you run `hb pull` from an empty directory, you'll only pull those four model files. You won't get the two UI-built models, or any additional resources built in the UI for that matter.

## `pull` resources originally built in the UI

You can also pull resources that were not built with the CLI. If you want to pull down a resource that was built in the UI, you have two options:

### 1. Pull all resources

You can use the `--all` flag to get every single Hashboard resource regardless of whether it was created with the CLI.

```bash copy
hb pull --all
```

### 2. Pull a specific resource with a GRN

You can pull down a specific resource by its [Global Resource Name](/docs/data-ops/resource-identifiers).

<Callout type="warning">
  When developing locally, you are not required to specify GRNs in Hashboard
  resource configuration files. However, when running `hb deploy`, GRNs are
  assigned based on the relative path from the working directory to the resource
  configuration file. Subsequent uses of `hb pull` should therefore be run from
  the same working directory.
</Callout>

```bash
# pull by a specific grn
hb pull m:s3AdinvBhsdJ:

# alternatively, pull by alias
hb pull m::my_sales_model
```

## Managing dbt state with `pull`

The behavior of `hb pull` is a bit different when used for dbt models. We cannot update models automatically inside of dbt files (since there could be jinja that we can't decompile).

Instead of updating resources in place, we'll create new model files outside of your dbt project. This lets you inspect the configuration and merge it into your dbt files.

## Config format used in `pull`

`hb pull` uses the most verbose (and specific) possible format of a resource. Some configuration that is just defaulted or configured by Hashboard will be exported.

For example: if you export a resource, it will default to being exported with a `pinned` [GRN](/docs/data-ops/resource-identifiers). You can remove the GRN to enable deploying the resource across different projects (or use an alias so that the resource is not bound to a specific instance in a single project).
