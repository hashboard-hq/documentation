# Hashboard `tables` command

The `tables` command allows you to see a list of all available tables within a specific data source when developing Hashboard resources via the CLI. To see the names of the data sources available in your project use the [`datasources ls`](./datasources#hb-datasources-ls) command.

```bash copy
hb tables [data source connection name]
```

```bash filename="Example usage" copy
hb tables bq_conn

ðŸ“‚ Available Tables From bq_conn
*  products
*  sales

```

These tables can be referenced when building out [model configurations](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/data-models). If you have a DuckDB connection you can upload files to use as tables directly from the CLI using the [`datasources upload`](./datasources#hb-datasources-upload) command.
