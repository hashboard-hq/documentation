# Hashboard `tables` command

The `tables` command allows you to see a list of all available tables within a specific database when developing Hashboard resources via the CLI. To see the names of the database connections available in your project use the [`databases`](./databases) command.

```bash copy
hb tables [database connection name]
```

```bash filename="Example usage" copy
hb tables bq_conn

📂 Available Tables From bq_conn
*  products
*  sales

```

These tables can be referenced when building out [model configurations](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/data-models). If you have a DuckDB connection you can upload files to use as tables directly from the CLI using the [`upload`](./upload) command.
