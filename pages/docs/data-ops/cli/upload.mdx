# Hashboard upload command

The upload command allows you to upload files directly to Hashboard that can be queried using [DuckDB](/docs/database-connections/duckdb) and used as the
basis for a data model.

```bash copy
hb upload [filepaths...]
```

Currently Hashboard supports uploading data as csv, tsv, json, or parquet files. These tables can be referenced when building out [model configurations](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/data-models).
