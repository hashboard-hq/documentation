# Hashboard upload command

The upload command allows you to upload files directly to a DuckDB database connection that can be queried using DuckDB or used as the
basis for a data model. To learn about how to configure a DuckDB connection please visit the [database connection reference](/docs/database-connections/duckdb). To see the names of the database connections available in your project use the [databases command](./databases).

```bash copy
hb upload [database connection name] [filepath]
```

Currently Hashboard supports uploading data as csv, tsv, json, or parquet files. These tables can be referenced when building out [model configurations](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/data-models).
