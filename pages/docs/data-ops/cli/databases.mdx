# Hashboard databases command

The databases command allows you to see a list of all available database connections when developing Hashboard resources via the CLI.

```

You can explore connections further using the [tables command](./tables) and upload files directly to Hashboard using the [upload command](./upload). To configure new connections check out the [Hashboard guide](/docs/database-connections) for connecting to your database.
