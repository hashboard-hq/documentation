The `databases` command allows you to see a list of all available database connections when developing Hashboard resources via the CLI.

You can explore connections further using the [`tables`](./tables) command and upload files directly to Hashboard using the [`upload`](./upload) command. To configure new connections check out the [Hashboard guide](/docs/database-connections) for connecting to your database.
