# Hashboard `token` command

The `token` command lets you authenticate the CLI. It will take you through a web-based authentication flow and download a new access key for you.

You can also go to your [`Settings`](https://hashboard.com/app/p/settings#access_keys) in the web UI to create and manage your access keys.

```bash copy
hb token
```

The created access key will be saved to `~/.hashboard/hb_access_key.json` which is where the CLI looks for your credentials by default.

If you'd like to store this at a different filepath, you can do so by either:

- Setting the `HASHBOARD_CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH` environment variable.

```bash copy
export HASHBOARD_CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH=your/absolute/filepath
hb token
```

- Using the `--credentials-filepath` command-line option.

```bash copy
hb --credentials-filepath your/absolute/filepath token
```
