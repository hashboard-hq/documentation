# Hashboard `deploy` command

The `deploy` command will update your Hashboard project with changes in your local configuration files.

`hb deploy` works with dbt and Git workflows:

<br />
<Cards>
  <Card
    arrow
    icon=" "
    title="dbt workflows"
    href="/docs/data-ops/dbt-integration"
  />
  <Card
    arrow
    icon=" "
    title="Git workflows"
    href="/docs/data-ops/git-integration"
  />
</Cards>

<br />

## Examples

```bash filename="examples"
# this will run a preview first and ask if you really want to deploy:
hb deploy

# this will skip the preview step
hb deploy --no-preview

# you can use deploy with dbt and git workflows:
hb deploy --dbt
hb deploy --git-revision=main
```

## Empty builds

By default, Hashboard prevents you from building empty projects, because this is usually a mistake (and could result in the deletion of resources). To get around this, you can pass in the flag `--allow-dangerous-empty-build`.
