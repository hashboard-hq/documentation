# `cache`

The `cache` command allows you fine grained control of the data cached in Hashboard.

## Clearing the cache

If you've just updated a specific data model and want to ensure that all users view the most recent data regardless of the default cache ttl you can clear the cache from the CLI.

```bash copy
hb cache clear m:MODEL_ID
```

To learn more about caching in Hashboard and how to control cache behavior via the GUI visit the Hashboard [caching reference](/docs/data-modeling/caching).
