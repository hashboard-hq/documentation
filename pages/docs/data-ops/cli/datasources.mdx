| Data connection name     | Data connection type | ID               |

You can explore data sources further using the [`tables`](./tables) command and upload files directly to Hashboard using the `datasources upload` command described below. To configure new connections check out the [Hashboard guide](/docs/database-connections) for connecting to your database.


### `hb datasources upload`
Upload files directly to Hashboard that can be queried using [DuckDB](/docs/database-connections/duckdb) and used as the
basis for a data model.

```bash copy
hb databases upload [filepaths...]
```

Currently Hashboard supports uploading data as csv, tsv, json, or parquet files. These tables can be referenced when building out [model configurations](/docs/data-ops/config-schema/data-models).
