# Report log

Hashboard keeps a record of all one-time and scheduled reports sent from your project. This comprehensive log allows you to track and review the history of your report distributions.

## Accessing the project-wide report log

You can access the project-wide report log in two ways:

1. Navigate directly to [https://hashboard.com/p/report-log](https://hashboard.com/p/report-log) in your Hashboard project.
2. Go to the [Scheduled Reports page](https://hashboard.com/app/p/scheduled-reports) and click the **Report log** button in the top right corner.

The project-wide report log displays a record of the most recent 200 one-time reports and reports sent out as part of report schedule.

## Accessing the report log for a specific scheduled report

Instead of seeing all your project's reports in the report log, you can view the report log for a specific scheduled report:

1. Navigate to the [Scheduled Reports page](https://hashboard.com/app/p/scheduled-reports).
2. Click on the desired scheduled report row in the list.

Like the project-wide report log, we display a truncated list of the 200 most recent reports for the selected scheduled report.

## Viewing a single report summary

Each row in the report log represents a single report distribution. You can click on a report row to view a summary of available information about the report, including:

- Destination (e.g., email addresses, Slack channels)
- Timing (date and time the report was sent)
- Report type (one-time or scheduled)
- Status (success, failure, pending)
- Full error message (if the report failed to send)
