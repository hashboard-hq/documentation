# Sharing to Slack

`Owners` can connect their Hashboard project to any Slack workspace. This lets users in your project
share saved explorations and dashboards directly to Slack channels with added notes and context. You can also schedule
automated reports to keep your team up to date with important metrics.

## Connect the integration

1. Go to [`Integrations`](https://hashboard.com/app/p/settings#integrations) section in the `Settings` page.
2. Under the `Slack` subsection, click `Add to Slack`.
3. Click `Allow` on the next page to authorize the Hashboard app for Slack to access your Slack workspace.
4. Click `Return to Settings` on the next page to return to Hashboard.

## Sharing to Slack

Once someone in your Hashboard project has connected the integration for Slack, Hashboard users with appropriate permissions
can share saved explorations and dashboards to Slack. By default, this is restricted to `Collaborators`.

1. Open a saved exploration or dashboard in Hashboard.
2. Click the `Share` dropdown at the top right corner and select the `Slack` option.
3. In the modal that opens, select the Slack channels you'd like to share to and optionally enter a comment with any context. Only public channels, and private channels to which you've specifically added the Hashboard app for Slack, will appear.
4. Click `Send` and your report will appear in Slack within the next minute or so.

## Chart image file type

Slack reports can be sent as either a PNG or PDF file, configured with the "Chart image file type" dropdown when sharing a resource to Slack.

PNGs are included inline in the Slack message, whereas PDF files are uploaded as a separate file into your Slack channel.
In general, images are easier to read from the Slack desktop app, but Slack will render them at low resolution when viewed on mobile devices.
You can experiment with the different file formats to see what works best for the Saved Exploration or Dashboard you are sharing.

Since it involves file uploads, PDF reports can only be shared to channels that have the @hashboard app as a member.

<Callout type="info">
  If you installed the Hashboard Slack app prior to February 28, 2024, you will
  need to re-install it to enable the PDF file type option. To do so, navigate
  to your [`Project Settings`](https://hashboard.com/app/p/settings), scroll
  down to the "Slack" section of "Integrations", and click "Reinstall".

## Interacting in Slack

When a Hashboard report is shared to Slack, it arrives with a few buttons prompting your team with next steps they can take:

1. **Open in Hashboard**: In a new browser tab, opens the Hashboard resource backing the report.
1. **Add Schedule**: In a new browser tab, opens a Hashboard modal for creating an automated schedule for the report.

## Scheduling Slack reports

You can configure recurring reports to be sent to Slack on a schedule by selecting **Schedule recurring report** at the bottom of the **Share to Slack** form and then clicking **Set Schedule**.

On the next page, you can configure your report schedule:

1. Choose when you want the report sent:
   - Daily
   - Weekly
   - Monthly
2. Pick the time you want it sent at (all times are in Eastern Time).

## What happens when reports fail

If there's a problem and data doesn't load:

- The Slack message won't be sent.
- A direct message is sent to the person who set up the report, letting them know there was a problem.

## Managing scheduled Slack reports

To change or delete a scheduled report, click "More" in the the sidebar and then [**Scheduled reports**](https://hashboard.com/app/p/scheduled-reports).

From there, you can edit or delete the reports you've scheduled.
