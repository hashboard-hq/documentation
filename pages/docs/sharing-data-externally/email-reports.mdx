# Email Reports

You can generate email reports for any Saved Exploration or Dashboard in Hashboard.

## How to send an email report

1. Go to the **Saved Exploration** or **Dashboard** you want to share.
2. Click the **Share** button on the top right.
3. Pick **Send as Email** from the dropdown.

When sending an email report:

- Specify a **Subject** of the report.
- Add the **Email Addresses** you want to send to. You can email a report to up to 25 recipients.
- Write an optional **Message** if you want. This will be included in the body of the email.

## Options

For **Saved Explorations**, you have a couple of extra options for what to include in the email:

1. **Chart image**: This puts a picture of the chart in the email.
2. **Chart data**: This attaches the aggregated data used to make the chart as a `.csv` file.
3. **Underlying data**: This attaches the non-aggregated data as a `.csv` file. You the attached file is limited to the first 100,000 rows of data.

For **Dashboards**, the email always includes a full-length image of the dashboard.

## Scheduling email reports

You can configure recurring email reports to be generated on a schedule by selecting **Schedule recurring report** at the bottom of the **Share as Email** form and then clicking **Set Schedule**.

On the next page, you can configure your report schedule:

1. Choose when you want the report sent:
   - Daily
   - Weekly
   - Monthly
2. Pick the time you want it sent at (all times are in Eastern Time).

## What happens when reports fail

If there's a problem and data doesn't load:

- The email report won't be sent.
- An alert email is sent to the person who set up the report, letting them know there was a problem.

## Managing scheduled email reports

To change or delete a scheduled report, click "More" in the the sidebar and then [**Scheduled reports**](https://hashboard.com/app/p/scheduled-reports).

From there, you can edit or delete the reports you've scheduled.
