# Google Sheets Reports

You can export chart or underlying data from any saved exploration in Hashboard into Google Sheets.

## Setting up your Google Sheets integration

1. Go to your [**Profile**](https://hashboard.com/app/p/profile) page.
2. Scroll down to the **Google Sheets Integration** section.
3. Click **Sign in to Google** and grant Hashboard access to read your Google Drive and write to Google Sheets. 
This will allow Hashboard to export data to Google Sheets on your behalf.
4. To verify the integration is working, Hashboard will display a list of spreadsheets we were able to find in your Google Drive - make sure that this looks as expected.

## Creating a Google Sheets report

Google Sheets reports are only available for saved explorations. To create a Google Sheets report, open the exploration you want to export, 
click the **Share** button in the top right, and then select **Google Sheets**.

There are a few options to configure:

1. **Spreadsheet**: Click **Select spreadsheet** and sign into the same Google account you used to set up the integration. 
You can navigate through your Google Drive to select the spreadsheet you want to export to.
2. **Tab**: Choose the tab in the spreadsheet where you want the data to be exported, or create a new tab and give it a name.
3. **Chart data** vs. **underlying data**: Choose whether you want to export the aggregated data used to generate the chart, or 
the underlying data from your data model. Funnel charts will always export chart data.
4. **One-time** or **recurring**: Choose whether you want to export the data once, or on a schedule.

## Scheduling Google Sheets reports

Just like email and slack reports, you can configure recurring Google Sheets reports to be generated on a 
schedule by selecting the **recurring** option when setting up the report.

You can configure your report schedule:

1. Choose when you want the report sent:
   - Daily
   - Weekly
   - Monthly
2. Pick the time you want it sent at (all times are in Eastern Standard Time).

## What happens when reports fail

If there's a problem and data doesn't load:

- The Sheets report won't be sent.
- You'll see an error on the [**Report history**](https://hashboard.com/app/p/report-history/) page.

## Managing scheduled Google Sheets reports

To change or delete a scheduled report, click "More" in the the sidebar and then [**Scheduled reports**](https://hashboard.com/app/p/scheduled-reports).

From there, you can manage the reports you've scheduled. You can edit the schedules of reports, but to change the spreadsheet or tab configurations,
you'll need to delete the report and create a new one.
