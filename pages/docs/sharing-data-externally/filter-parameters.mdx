# Filter Parameters

Hashboard allows you to apply additional filters to your explorations and dashboards using URL parameters.

Common use cases for filter URL parameters include:

- Embedding a filtered view inside another application, using context from outside the iframe
- Generating Hashboard URLs from a script or external application

Filter URL parameters are supported when viewing Hashboard resources as a logged-in user on the web application or in embedded iframes. They are not supported for public links.

## Filtering Explorations with URL Parameters

To apply a filter to an [exploration](../visualizing-data/explorations) via a URL parameter, append `?filters=[...]` to your Hashboard URL, using a URL-encoded list of filter JSON specifications. The keys in these JSON objects match those used in the YAML specification visible in the resource’s [code editor](../data-ops/yaml-editor).

Any valid filter added through the code editor can also be applied via the URL. If a filter is applied to a `columnId` that already has a filter in the base exploration, the URL filter will override the existing one.

You can also use the `filters` URL parameter with [Saved Explorations](../visualizing-data/explorations#creating-a-saved-exploration). When applied, Hashboard will start a new exploration with the provided filters.

## Filtering Dashboards with URL Parameters

[Dashboards](../dashboards) support pre-selecting global filter values using the `filters` URL parameter.

To set global filter values, append `?filters=[...]` to your Hashboard URL with a URL-encoded list of filter JSON specifications. The `columnId` of each filter must correspond to a global filter control on your dashboard. The `dataModel` key is optional—if omitted, the filter will apply to the first global filter that matches the provided `columnId`.

## Examples

Note that most modern browsers will automatically encode your URL when pasted into the address bar.

### Filtering a single column by a list of values

Filter YAML:

```yaml
filters:
  - columnId: m::orders.type
    values:
      - Single Order
      - Subscription
```

URL parameter:

```
?filters=[{"columnId":"m::orders.type","values":["Single Order","Subscription"]}]
```

Encoded URL parameter:

```
?filters=%5B%7B%22columnId%22%3A%22m%3A%3Aorders.type%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%22Single%20Order%22%2C%22Subscription%22%5D%7D%5D
```

### Filtering multiple columns

Filter YAML:

```yaml
filters:
  - columnId: timestamp
    range:
      - - -6
        - month
        - startOfPeriod: false
      - - 0
        - minute
  - columnId: item_number
    gt: 2
```

URL Parameter:

```
?filters=[{"columnId":"timestamp","range":[[-6,"month",{"startOfPeriod":false}],[0,"minute"]]},{"columnId":"item_number","gt":2}]
```

Encoded URL parameter:

```
?filters=%5B%7B%22columnId%22%3A%22timestamp%22%2C%22range%22%3A%5B%5B-6%2C%22month%22%2C%7B%22startOfPeriod%22%3Afalse%7D%5D%2C%5B0%2C%22minute%22%5D%5D%7D%2C%7B%22columnId%22%3A%22item_number%22%2C%22gt%22%3A2%7D%5D
```
