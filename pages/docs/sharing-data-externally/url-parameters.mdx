# URL Parameters

Hashboard supports using URL parameters to apply additional filters to your explorations and dashboards.

Use cases for using filter URL parameters includes:

- Embedding a view inside of another application, filtered using context from outside the iframe
- Generating Hashboard URLs from a script or other application

Filter URL parameters are supported when viewing Hashboard resources as a logged-in user on the web application or within embedded iframes. They are not supported when sharing resources as public links.

## Filtering explorations with URL parameters

To apply a filter to an exploration with a URL parameter, append `?filters=[...] to your Hashboard URL with a URL-encoded list of filter JSON specifications. The keys of these JSON objects are the same keys used in the yml specification visible in the code editor of the resource.

Any valid filter that can be added through the code editor can also be applied via the URL. If your URL-provided filter is applied to a `columnId` that already has a filter applied in the base exploration, that filter will be overriden.

The `filter` URL parameter can also be used with Saved Explorations. When applied, Hashboard will start a new exploration with those filters applied.

## Filtering dashboards with URL parameters

Dashboars support setting global filter values with the `filters` URL parameter.

To use this, append `?filters=[...]` to your Hashboard URL with a URL-encoded list of filter JSON specifications. The `columnId` of each filter must correspond to the `columnId` of a global filter control present on your dashboard. Including the `dataModel` key is optional -- if you exclude it, the filter will be applied to the first global filter that matches the provided `columnId`.
