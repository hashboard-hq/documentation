# Seat Types and User Roles

Hashboard uses a seat-based licensing model with two distinct seat types: Editor and Collaborator.
Each user in your Hashboard instance occupies either an Editor or Collaborator seat based on their assigned roles and permissions.

> **Note:** The Editor and Collaborator seat types share names with our default system-defined roles
> (see [Managing Users and Roles](/docs/users-and-permissions/managing-users-and-roles)),
> but seat type and role-name are distinct concepts. Hashboard's default role named "Editor" that comes with every new project can be modified to no longer be considered an
> Editor seat type, and similarly, a role named "Collaborator" can be adjusted to have permissions that qualify it as an Editor seat type.

## Understanding seat types

### Editor Seats

Editors are users who can modify data models and have broader control over the analytics environment.
A user is considered an Editor if they have any of the following permissions:

- `CREATE_DATA_MODEL`
- `UPDATE_DATA_MODEL`
- `APPLY_DRAFT`

### Collaborator Seats

Collaborators are users who can view, explore, and interact with data models but cannot modify them.
These users typically focus on data consumption and analysis rather than data model management.

## Seat type assignment

- Users are automatically assigned a seat type based on the roles they are assigned within a project.
- If a user has multiple roles with different permission levels, they will be assigned an Editor seat if any of their roles include Editor-level permissions
- Seat type assignment is dynamic and will update if a user's roles or permissions change

## Users in multiple projects

Organizations can have multiple projects within Hashboard (such as with [Partner Projects](docs/sharing-data-externally/partner-projects)), and users of that organization can belong to multiple projects.
