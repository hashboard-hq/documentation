# Seat Types and User Roles

Hashboard uses a seat-based licensing model with two distinct seat types: Developer and Consumer.
Each user in your Hashboard instance occupies either an Developer or Consumer seat based on their assigned roles and permissions.

## Understanding seat types

### Developer Seats

Developers are users who can modify data models and have broader control over the analytics environment.
A user is considered an Developer if they have any of the following permissions:

- `CREATE_DATA_MODEL`
- `UPDATE_DATA_MODEL`
- `APPLY_DRAFT`

Hashboard's system-defined roles of Owner and Editor are considered Developer seats by default but can be configured to suit your organization's needs.

### Consumer Seats

Consumers are users who can view, explore, and interact with data models but cannot modify them.
These users typically focus on data consumption and analysis rather than data model management.

## Seat type assignment

- Users are automatically assigned a seat type based on the roles they are assigned within a project.
- If a user has multiple roles with different permission levels, they will be assigned an Developer seat if any of their roles include Developer-level permissions
- Seat type assignment is dynamic and will update if a user's roles or permissions change

Hashboard's system-defined roles of Collaborator, Collaborator Plus, and Viewer are considered Consumer seats in their initial configuration but can be configured to suit your organization's needs.

## Users in multiple projects

Organizations can have multiple projects within Hashboard (such as with [Partner Projects](docs/sharing-data-externally/partner-projects)), and users of that organization can belong to multiple projects.
