## Embed external content

You can embed external content in your dashboards using an embed block.

To add an embed block, drag the embed icon from the toolbar onto your dashboard. Then add the URL of the content you want to embed.

Not all websites allow embedding. If the URL you've added does not load, it is likely that the website has 
[explicitly prohibited embedding of their content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options). 
Often this is done for security reasons. Many sites provide embed friendly versions of their content with a special URL or query parameter.

### What can types of things can I embed?

There are a myriad of things you can embed in your dashboards to make them more useful. Here are some examples:
- __Documentation__: Embed your organization's internal documentation in your dashboards to make it easy for your team to find the information they need.
- __Video__: Embed a video to share a demo or walkthrough of your data with your team.
