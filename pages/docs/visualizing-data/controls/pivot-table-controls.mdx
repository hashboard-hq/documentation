# Pivot Table controls

<Callout type="warning">
  Support for pivot tables will be ending in the near future, as tables can now
  specify columns to pivot on. <br /> <br/>
  Pivot tables should only be used for pivoting on a broken out attribute, which is currently unsupported in tables. 
  Most use cases of pivots can be migrated to tables by specifying a pivot's broken out attribute as a table `column` instead.

</Callout>

The following sections are available in the control panel for configuring Pivot Table visualizations.

### Filters

Use this section to apply filters to your dataset. To add a new filter, click the **+** button.

For more information on how to use filters, see the [Filtering](../filter) documentation.

### Table options

This section contains options for customizing the appearance of the table.

- **Palette**: Defines color for breakout values.
- **Compact Padding**: Reduces space between table cells.
- **Hide Zero Values**: Omits zeros from the display.
- **Visualizations**: Add bar visualizations within table cells.
- **Formatting rules**: Apply conditional formatting to table cells.

### Rows

Use this section to set which attribute's values will appear as the row headers in your pivot table.

Additional options:

- **Sort order**: Configures how attribute values are ordered in the visualization.
- **Limit rows**: Configures the maximum number of rows that will be displayed. Defaults to 10,000.

### Columns

Use this section to set which attribute's values will appear as the column headers in your pivot table. This is configured as a Color Breakout. For more information about how to configure a Breakout, see the [Breakout](../breakout) documentation.

### Value

Use this section to configure which measure will be used for the values in the pivot table cells.
