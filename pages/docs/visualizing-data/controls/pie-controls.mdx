# Pie chart controls

The following sections are available in the control panel for configuring pie charts.

### Filters

This section applies filters to your dataset. To add a new filter, click the **+** button.

For more information on how to use filters, see the [Filtering](../filter) documentation.

### Chart formatting

This section contains options for customizing how your chart is displayed:

- **Palette**: Sets the color scheme for the chart.
- **Value labels**: Labels each datapoint with its numeric value.
- **Legend**: Displays a color legend. When enabled, you can control the positioning of the legend by clicking Top, Right, Bottom, or Left, and you can also choose whether the legend title is displayed by toggling "Show Legend Title".

### Breakout

This section controls which attributes will be shown as a color breakout, one of which must always be configured in a pie chart, or which will be shown a trellis. For additional information about Breakouts, see the [Breakout](../breakout) documentation.

### Measures

This section controls which measures are plotted on your chart. If there are multiple measures, each measure will be plotted as separate pie chart (in other words, the chart will be trellised by measure).
