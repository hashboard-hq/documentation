# Control Panel Settings inÂ the Data Explorer

The Control Panel in the Data Explorer allows you to customize various aspects of your visualizations. Access the Control Panel by clicking the **Controls \<\<** button located at the top right of the Data Explorer screen. Then select the **Settings** tab to view available options.

## Filters

In this section, you can add filters to refine your data. To add a new filter, click the **+** button. Filters apply criteria to your data, affecting the visualizations you create.

For more information on how to use filters, see the [Filtering](./filter) documentation.

## Breakout

The Breakout section allows you to group your data based on the values of or more attributes.

For additional information about Breakouts, see [Learn More about Breakouts](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/visualizing-data/breakout).

### Controls for Area, Bar, and Line charts

#### Chart formatting
- **Palette**: Sets the color scheme for the chart.
- **Axis Labels**: Enables the display of attribute or metric names on the x and y axes.
- **Value labels**: Labels each datapoint with its numeric value.
- **Legend**: Displays a color legend. When enabled, you can control the positioning of the legend by clicking Top, Right, Bottom, or Left, and you can also choose whether the legend title is displayed by toggling "Show Legend Title".

#### X Axis

Allows you to set which attribute will be shown on the x-axis. The attribute must be either date or numeric.

#### Y Axis

Select which measures to plot on your chart. For each measure, you can choose which axis its range is tied to (left axis or right axis),
as well as customize whether the measure is displayed as a bar, line, or area on the chart canvas.

#### Axis configuration

Here you can configure the Left and Right Y Axes with the following options:
- **Range**: Set the minimum and maximum values. By default, both of these are "auto", which means the range will be adjusted to show all values in the dataset. An auto range will always include 0.
- **Scale**: Choose between Linear and Logarithmic scaling. This controls the spacing between different values on that axis.
