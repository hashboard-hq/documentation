# Period-over-period Comparisons

Period-over-period comparisons allow you to compare timeseries data from different periods of time. They can be configured via the control panel on the right-hand side of the Data Explorer, under the `Compare` heading.

Currently, Hashboard supports `Previous Year`, `Previous Month`, and `Previous Week` comparisons.

Comparisons will be applied as a breakout to your chart, as follows:

    Note - In order to effectively compare across periods, your chart granularity (daily, weekly, monthly, etc) 
    must be **equal or narrower** than the period you're comparing.
