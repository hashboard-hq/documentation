# Chart Types

In this documentation, we provide an overview of various chart types available in Hashboard.

## Bar, Area, Line Charts

Bar, Area, and Line charts all work very similarly in Hashboard. These chart types are all designed for exploring time series [Measures](/docs/data-modeling/measures) as defined in your [Data Models](/docs/data-modeling.mdx).

Bar charts represent data with rectangular bars. The height of the bars is proportional to the measure values they represent. Bar charts are a good default for a single measure time series. They clearly communicate granularity and it is easy to spot when there is missing data or the value is zero.

Line charts represent data points connected by a line. They are useful for comparing series values directly against one another. e.g. comparing call volumes between departments.

Area charts are similar to line charts, but fill the area under the lines. Area charts emphasize the total area taken up by a series. They work particularly well for charts showing proportional changes of a whole over time.

Glean also supports the ability to layer multiple mark types together in a single chart. The example above has separate y-axis for each series of data.

## Horizontal Bar Chart

Horizontal bar charts are extremely effective data visualizations for comparing total values across categories.

  Make sure to pick the right sorting for your viewers. Should you sort by the
  the category names or the measure values? Our other chart types are naturally
  sorted by time, but here you need to be a bit more careful.

## Table

<Iframe src="https://demo.hashboard.com/public/sv/1a403d2b-69a0-3348-a97f-9d6022b2a7ac" />

Hashboard tables provide powerful options for visualization, formatting, and grouping. Tables are often the best option when comparing multiple [Measures](/docs/data-modeling/measures) and breakouts at the same time.

## Pivot Table

Pivot tables allow you to take a table and break out columns. They enable you to quickly examine the effects of multiple dimensions of the data on a single measure.

## Source Data Table

<Iframe src="https://demo.hashboard.com/public/sv/f814e94b-66c9-3cf7-8cee-b8039a7d7ca1" />

Source data tables show the underlying data from your data warehouse. They provide raw data that can be used for further analysis or exported to other tools.
