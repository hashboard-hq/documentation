# SQL Runner

Hashboard's SQL Runner allows you to write arbitrary SQL to quickly query your data across data connections.

To open the runner, press `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows/Linux). Alternatively, you can click `More` in the nav bar, then click `SQL runner`.

Once opened, select a data connection on the top left, then write SQL and click `Run` (or `Cmd + Enter`) see results. You can also click <div style={{display: "inline-flex", alignItems: "baseline"}}><Eye style={{height: 16, alignSelf: "center"}} /> <strong>Preview</strong></div> next to any table on the left side to directly view its contents.

You can also pre-populate the SQL Runner with the underlying query backing any Hashboard exploration. To do so, open a saved exploration, click the advanced menu (<MoreVertical style={{height: 16, display: "inline"}} />) on the top right of the page, then click `Open in SQL runner`.
