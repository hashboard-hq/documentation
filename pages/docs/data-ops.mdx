## Code-based Business Intelligence

In Hashboard, you can define one or more of your Hashboard resources using **configuration files**. A configuration file contains a complete specification of a resource. For instance, a Model configuration file contains information about which database connection to use, the name of the underlying database table, a list of attributes and measures, etc.

Using a set of configuration files, you create a **build**. A Hashboard build is a collection of changes that you've defined as code. These changes can be **validated**, **previewed**, and **applied** to your project.

By default, Hashboard resources that were applied with code can still be edited by users through the Hashboard UI. New versions of your resources can be **pulled** down to your filesystem to keep your codebase in sync. You can also choose to restrict resources to only be changeable through code-based builds.
