# Developer Reference

Hashboard allows you to represent your resources as configuration files, which can be stored in a Git repository and deployed to your Hashboard project as part of a change management workflow.

- ‚úÖ **Validate** planned changes to your data warehouse or Hashboard resources to ensure that your views and dashboards don't break
- üèóÔ∏è **Preview updates** to your Hashboard project before making them visible to the rest of your organization
- üë• Use **code reviews** or pull requests to collaborate on proposed changes
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Configure Hashboard** using the same tools that you use to develop your backend pipelines
- üö¶ Use a **continuous integration** system to deploy updates to your Hashboard project

## Code-based Business Intelligence in Hashboard

You can define one or more of your Hashboard resources using **configuration files**. A configuration file contains a complete specification of a resource. For instance, a Model configuration file contains information about which database connection to use, the name of the underlying database table, a list of attributes and metrics, etc.

Using a set of configuration files, you create a **Build**. There are two different kinds of Builds:

- A **Preview Build** validates your configuration files and, if successful, provides a URL that will show you what your Hashboard Project will look like if your pending changes are applied.
- A **Deploy Build** validates your configuration files and, if successful, publishes those changes to your Hashboard Project.

<Callout type="warning">
  We recommend always first creating a Preview Build to see which resources will
  be affected prior to running a Deploy. The build process will automatically
  delete and create resources in Hashboard to leave your project in a consistent
  state. For example, if you delete a column in a model configuration file, all
  saved explorations that refer to that column will be automatically deleted (as
  happens if you delete a column through the user interface).  Pull the [configuration](/docs/data-ops/cli/pull) of one
  or more of your resources to your local environment or a Git repository. Then,
  you can create a Build using the [Hashboard command-line interface
  (CLI)](/docs/data-ops/using-the-glean-cli), or through the Hashboard web
  application by connecting your account to a [Git
  repository](/docs/data-ops/git-integration).
