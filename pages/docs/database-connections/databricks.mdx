# Databricks

[Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) is a data analytics platform built on top of Apache Spark. 

Databricks allows you to combine the robustness of a data warehouse with the flexibility of a data lake via their 
[Lakehouse architecture](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse).
It provides a unified platform that offers a wide variety of services, allowing you to store and process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, 
including real-time analytics. 

Databricks can be especially useful for machine learning/artificial intelligence, data engineering, and data science applications.

### How to get set up

1. Sign up for a Databricks account or trial and create a workspace. You can find instructions on how to set up an account and workspace 
[here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/index.html). 
2. Databricks automatically configures a "Starter Warehouse" for new users. 
You can find it by clicking the "SQL Warehouses" link in the left sidebar of your Databricks workspace. 
You can find instructions on how to create or configure a warehouse [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/sql-warehouse/create-sql-warehouse.html).
3. Generate a [personal access token](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#pat-user) in Databricks for a user with access to the data you want to query:
    * In the right corner of your Databricks workspace, click the user icon and navigate to "User Settings".
    * In the left pane, click into the "Developer" controls. Click the "Manage" button in the "Access tokens" section.
    * Click "Generate New Token". You will be asked to configure the token's lifespan. Finally, click "Generate".
    * Copy the token and save it somewhere safe. You will not be able to access it again.
4. Clicking the name of your warehouse in the "SQL Warehouses" page and then selecting the "Connection details" tab, you can find the hostname and HTTP path of your warehouse.
5. In Hashboard, go to the [Data sources](https://hashboard.com/app/p/data-sources) page.
6. Click `+ Add connection`, select `Databricks` and fill out the fields below.

### Settings

- **Connection Name:** A nickname for your connection. Not used to connect to your database.
- **Host**: The server hostname of the SQL warehouse. Can be found in the Connection Details tab of your SQL warehouse.
- **Port**: _(optional)_ The port to connect to. Set to 443 by default.
- **HTTP path**: The HTTP path of the SQL warehouse. Can be found in the Connection Details tab of your SQL warehouse.
