# Funnels

Funnels are the basic building block of event analytics. They provide a way to see how an entity (or set of entities) completes a sequence of steps.

## Configuration

### Step sequence
The step sequence is the ordered list of events which an entity must perform to complete the funnel. Step sequences can be edited during explore, or defined in the model for quicker access and sharing.

Steps are just a named condition to match a given event to. The most common condition is simply matching the name of an event. You can click the settings icon next to a step to edit the conditions directly. Using this, you can specify more nuanced steps, such as "a view_page event with '/blog' in the URL" instead of just "a view_page event".

### Filters
Filters are applied to every event _before_ any funneling logic occurs. Since funnel queries can be more expensive than standard aggregates, this can be used to reduce the amount of data you are processing, or to focus your analysis to a particular time region or segment.

Note that if you apply a historical timestamp filter, you may see lower conversion rates toward the end of the time window. The entity may not have had time to finish the funnel before the filter cut the data off.

### Time limit
A time limit applies a maximum duration which a entity can spend within a funnel. Hashboard will match the first event as normal. Subsequent events for that entity must all occur within the time limit of their first event. After the time limit is up, all their future events will be ignored.

All entities are still evaluated only a single time. If an entity entered a funnel, timed out, and then later re-entered the funnel and succeeded, they would still be counted as not converting, as their "first attempt" at the funnel timed out.

### Breakouts & segmentation

You can break out a funnel to see how different segments perform. Breakouts split the entities into distinct groups, and perform the funnel analysis once for each group.

When breaking out on an attribute related to the entity, such as a user's `membership_type`, this works like a standard `GROUP BY`. Each user is still only evaluated once, and then bucketed into separate groups based on the breakout. No overlap will occur.

When breaking out on other attributes, **a single entity may be evaluated multiple times**, since the value of the broken out column may change over the course of the funnel. The breakout splits groups based on the broken out column of the _first matched event_. For example, imagine a simple funnel with steps `ad_impression` -> `purchase`. We break out on `platform`, which will split funnels based on the `platform` users received the _ad_impression_ on (not the platform they made the purchase, which may be the same or different). If a given user saw an ad on both "mobile" and on "desktop", then they would appear in _both_ the "mobile" and "desktop" segments.

## How it works

The main task of funnel analysis is matching event data to form "journeys" for each entity, a path of events where each event maps to the next sequence step.

For each entity, we search for an event of theirs which matches the first step of the funnel. For all the entities for whom we found an event, we look for another event of theirs which matches the second step of the funnel, _and_ occurs after their first event. For all the entities for whom we found a matching second event, we look for another event of theirs which matches the third step of the funnel, _and_ occurs after their second event. This process can repeat for up 62 distinct steps.

Breakouts further partition this, so instead of evaluating each entity, we evaluate each distinct entity:breakout-value pair.

Performing the process described above directly in SQL would be highly inefficient. Instead, we implement the SQL using a technique in which event types are hashed to string characters, concatenated together, and then searched for matches using regular expressions. A similar approach to ours is outlined in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@pragya.deep19/funnel-analytics-using-bigquery-4c521a75649). This technique results in a complex, but efficient query.

{/* Note that if a user purchased something, but didn’t see an ad before their purchase, they wouldn’t be included in the funnel. They would only counted in the users row. Users must match every proceeding step in order to be included in step in the funnel. For this reason, funnels strictly decrease as they move downward. */}
