# Profile Identity

Your personal profile is listed at the top of the [`People`](https://hashboard.com/app/p/people)
page for a project.

## Display Name

This is how Hashboard will refer to you and reference you to other users.
This can be your first name, a nickname, or any other moniker you're known by.

## Full Name

Please enter your full name. Hashboard will use this name in contexts where a
display name may be ambiguous.

## Email/Username

The email associated with an account cannot be changed directly.

If you need assistance migrating an existing account to a new email, please
get in touch with our support team.

## Avatar Image

Your avatar is automatically loaded from your auth provider.
If your auth provider does not provide an image, your avatar will default to
the initials of your full name.
