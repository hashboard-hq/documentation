# Appearance

Users can select between light/dark/system appearances for the Hashboard interface.
This option is per-user. This setting is listed in your profile settings at the top of the
[`People`](https://hashboard.com/app/p/people) page.

## Light Mode

This is the default Hashboard experience. All [public links](../sharing-data-externally/public-links.mdx) and
[embeds](../sharing-data-externally/iframe-embedding.mdx) will use this theme.

## Dark Mode

Beyond the obvious change (the UI is darker), Dark Mode has some additional
modifications from the light experience to ensure a consistent level of contrast.

[Chart colors](../project-management/custom-styles.mdx) are automatically adjusted
slightly to ensure they are visible on a dark background. A user viewing
a chart in dark mode will still see the same hues, but particularly dark color
values will have a slight boost in luminosity.

## Match System

With this setting, Hashboard will automatically adjust to light or dark mode
based on the preference of your system.
