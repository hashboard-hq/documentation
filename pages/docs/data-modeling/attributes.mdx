# Attributes

Attributes are one of the main building blocks of data models in Hashboard. They sit on top of columns in your underlying database, and enable things like filtering and grouping when exploring your data.

You can setup and update attributes from the [Add Data Model](/docs/data-modeling/add-data-model) workflow.


## Types

The following attribute types are supported in Hashboard:

| Type           | Description                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Strings        | Textual data like (names, emails, etc)   |
| Numbers        | Numeric values (integers, decimals, etc) |
| Dates          | Time-based data (dates, timestamps, etc) |
| Arrays         | Collections of values                    |
| Booleans       | True/false values                        |


## Configuration

Attributes can be configured with the following optional settings:

- **Description**: A readable description about the attribute - this will be surfaced when doing data explorations downstream. These can also be [synced directly from your database](/docs/data-modeling/description-syncing).
- **Binning**: (numbers only) A default bin width for the attribute - when doing data explorations, this will be used to automatically group numeric values into buckets.
- **Primary date**: (dates only) This can be set on date attributes - it will be used throughout Hashboard as the default for time-based data explorations of your model.
- **Primary key**: (numbers and strings only) This can be set on any unique string or numeric attribute to enable joining to another model. See [Model Joins](/docs/data-modeling/model-joins) for more info.
