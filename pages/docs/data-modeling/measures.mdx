# Measures

Measures are measurements that can go up and down over time.
Each measure should map to a measurement of a process or workflow in your organization.
Counts of events, revenues and cycle times are good examples of measures you may want to add to your data model.

You can setup and update measures from the [Add Data Model](/docs/data-modeling/add-data-model) workflow.

## Types of measures

| Name           | Input Column Type        | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| row count      | No input column required | Count of rows.                                                                                                                |
| custom measure | No input column required | A SQL-based custom aggregation. See [Custom SQL Measures](/docs/data-modeling/measures#custom-sql-measures) for more details. |
| count          | String or Numeric        | SQL `COUNT()`. Counts the number of non-null values in a column.                                                              |
| count distinct | String or Numeric        | SQL `COUNT(DISTINCT)`. Counts the number of unique, non-null values in a column.                                              |
| min            | Numeric                  | SQL `MIN()`. Finds the minimum value of a column.                                                                             |
| max            | Numeric                  | SQL `MAX()`. Finds the maximum value of a column.                                                                             |
| avg            | Numeric                  | SQL `AVG()`. Finds the arithmetic mean of a column.                                                                           |

## The row count measure

The row count measure is added by default to a data model and can't be removed. This is intentional - see the best practices for defining this measure in the [Data Modeling Best Practices](/docs/data-modeling/best-practices).

## Column aggregations

The simplest type of measure. See table above for which functions you can run on specific measures.

To add a column aggregating measure:

1. Go to the [Add Data Model](/docs/data-modeling/add-data-model) workflow by creating a new data model or editing an existing model.
2. In the list of fields, click `Add measure` next to the name of the field you'd like to aggregate.
3. Click on the new item in the measure list to expand the and select the aggregation type.

## Custom SQL measures

Custom SQL measures allow you to have more involved custom aggregations in Hashboard like weighted averages or proportions and other formulas. You can define a custom measure as any [aggregating function](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/aggregate-functions-sql) that results in a numeric value.

To add a custom measure:

1. Go to the [Add Data Model](/docs/data-modeling/add-data-model) workflow by creating a new data model or editing an existing model.
2. Under the Measures section click the `+ Add Custom Measure` button.
3. Enter your aggregation and click the ðŸ”„ button to test the SQL.

### Referencing other measures or attributes

Custom measures can refer to other measures or attributes to avoid duplicating logic.
For instance, a **Profit** measure could be defined by deducting the **Costs** measure from the **Revenue** measure.

```sql filename="SQL for Profit measure"
{{ revenue }} - {{ cost }}
```

SQL can reference other measures or attributes by surrounding their `alias` in double curly braces.
When querying, Hashboard will expand references to their full definitions.

### Using joined columns in custom SQL

See [Using Joined Columns in Custom SQL](./model-joins#using-joined-columns-in-custom-sql) for more info.

## Measure folders

You can organize your measures and [attributes](/docs/data-modeling/attributes#attribute-folders) into folders to keep your data model tidy and easy to navigate.

To organize your measures into folders in a data model:

1. Open the data model in the [Model builder](/docs/data-modeling).
2. Select the measure you want to move to a folder.
3. In the measure configuration pane, locate the `Folder` input field.
4. To move a measure into an existing folder, select the folder in the dropdown. To create a new folder, type the desired name into the search input and click the option to `Add` a new folder with that name.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each measure you want to organize into a folder.
6. Once youâ€™re finished, save the data model.
7. Start exploring the data model, and youâ€™ll see your folders in the [Data tray](/docs/visualizing-data/data-tray).
