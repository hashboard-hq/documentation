# Resource Lineage

Understanding Resource Lineage is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of your Hashboard projects. This feature provides a comprehensive view of dependencies among various resources, enabling better decision-making when making changes.

## Automatic dependency checks

Hashboard validates dependencies in real-time when you make changes that could impact a dashboard or other resources. 

#### Examples of dependency checks

- Deleting a measure or attribute used in a saved exploration triggers a warning and shows you which saved explorations would be affected by your change.
- Deleting a data model that's in use shows all current usages.
- When triggering a project build preview, downstream impacts of your changes are listed.

## Viewing resource lineage

The Resource Lineage can be viewed as a dependency graph giving you different perspectives on how resources are connected.
