# Resource Lineage

Understanding Resource Lineage is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of your Hashboard projects. This feature provides a comprehensive view of dependencies among various resources, enabling better decision-making when making changes.

## Automatic dependency checks

Hashboard validates dependencies in real-time when you make changes that could impact a dashboard or other resources.

#### Examples of dependency checks

- Deleting a measure or attribute used in a saved exploration triggers a warning and shows you which saved explorations would be affected by your change.
- Deleting a data model that's in use shows all current usages.
- When triggering a project build preview, downstream impacts of your changes are listed.

## Viewing resource lineage

The Resource Lineage can be viewed as a dependency graph giving you different perspectives on how resources are connected.

### Via the resource lineage page

## Column-level lineage

You can see the column-level lineage for any measure or attribute, which can help you when refactoring code or trying to see the impacts of your changes.

1. Goto to the [models page](https://hashboard.com/app/p/data-models)
2. Edit a model
3. Click on any attribute or measure to show the details
