# Organize Content with Collections

Collections allow you to group related saved explorations, dashboards, or other collections
together to allow your organization to more easily find and share related data.

You can navigate to a collection by clicking on it in the left sidebar or searching for
by name in project search.

When viewing collections, you can choose between card mode and list mode by clicking the
"Card mode" or "List mode" buttons on the right side of the collection page. Card mode shows resources in
a grid view with a visual preview of the resource. List mode shows a list of resources alongside metadata
for each resource.

## Adding resources to collections

Once inside a collection, you can add resources using the
"Add resource" button. You can also reorder items within the collection by dragging
them around in card mode or in the left sidebar.

You can also set the collection a resource belongs to when editing them
or creating new ones.

The same resource cannot be in multiple collections at once.

## Presentation view

Select "Present" within a collection to hop into a view of all the collection's
contents. This link can be shared with users in your project for a minimal,
clean view of a group of related data, perfect for a slide-show or other
presentation.

## Creating sub-collections

Collections can be nested within each other to allow for fine-grain organization.
You may have an "OKRs" collection with a subcollection for each quarter, for
example.

From within a collection, click "New Sub Collection" to create a sub-collection.
You can move a collection into being a sub-collection (or visa versa) by selecting
"Move to Collection..." in the three dots menu.
