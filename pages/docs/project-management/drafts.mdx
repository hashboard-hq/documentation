# Drafts

Drafts are a way to test or propose changes to your Hashboard project safely. 
Drafted resources can be created, updated, and deleted, and can be applied to your project in a single operation. 

## Creating a draft
Drafts live in the [Drafts page](https://hashboard.com/app/p/drafts) within a project. 

To create a draft, click the `New draft` button. You'll be prompted for a name and description, which can be changed later.

Once you've created a draft, you can enter the draft by clicking on the `Start drafting` button. 

While in a draft, you should see an orange button at the top of the page with the name of the draft. 
This means you're safe to interact with the project and make changes to resources, knowing that they will not be applied to your project until you're ready.
Clicking that button will navigate you out of the draft and to a page which shows you which resources have been modified by that draft.

### Permissions

Drafts are public and shared across a project. Any user within a project can enter a draft. 

However, certain permissions are required to create and apply drafts:
* To create a draft, a user must have one of the following permissions: `CREATE_DATA_MODEL`, `CREATE_SAVED_VIEW`, `CREATE_METRIC`, or `CREATE_DASHBOARD`.
* To apply a draft to a project, a user must have the `CREATE_DATA_MODEL_REPO_BUILD` permisison.

While in a draft, users have the same permissions within draft mode as they do when interacting with other project resources. 
For example, if a user does not have permission to edit a model, they will still not be able to edit a model in a draft.

### Resources that can be drafted

The following resources can be created, updated, and deleted within a draft:
* Data models
* Saved explorations
* Metrics
* Dashboards
* Homepage launchpads

Notably, while in a draft, you cannot make changes to:
* Data sources
* Collections
* Project settings
* Users and permissions


## Validating drafts

When developing a draft, it's possible that the draft may enter an invalid state. 

Similar to a merge conflict in Git, this can happen if changes are made to the project that are incompatible with the changes in the draft.

To check the status of your draft against your project at any time, you can click the `Validate` button to surface the warnings and errors generated by your draft:
* **Warnings** do not block the draft from being applied, but should be reviewed. 
* **Errors** block the draft from being applied. This typically means that there is a resource within the draft that has a critical dependency that cannot be resolved â€“ 
 for example, a drafted saved exploration that references a model that has been trashed within the base project.

## Applying drafts

When you're ready to apply your draft to your project, click the `Apply` button. 

If there are no conflicts, the draft will be applied to your project, and your drafted changes will be merged into your project.
A green checkmark will appear next to the name of the draft to indicate that the application was successful. 

If there are validation errors, you have the choice to either go back into the draft and resolve the errors, or start a new draft from scratch.
