# Setting Up Email or Slack Alerts

Create alerting to stay updated on key activity.

<Steps>

### Choose your alerting cadence

Determine if you want `Daily`, `Weekly`, or `Monthly` alerting.

### Data Visualization

Create a saved exploration that aligns with your alert frequency.

Utilize table visualizations for the best results.

<Callout type="info">
    For daily alerts on new accounts, filter to show accounts created *yesterday* for comprehensive data.
</Callout>

### Setup the notification

- Click `Share` and select either `Email` or `Slack`.
- Opt for `Schedule Recurring Report`.
- Hit `Set Schedule` and match the frequency with your data filter.
- Ensure `Skip Reports with Empty Data` is checked.

<Callout type="info">
    Alerts are generated based on your set frequency, but notifications are only sent when relevant data is found, keeping you informed without cluttering your inbox or Slack.
