# Setup email and Slack alerts

Setup email and Slack alerting to stay updated on key activities.

<Steps>

### Choose your alerting cadence

Determine if you want `Daily`, `Weekly`, or `Monthly` alerting.

### Setup a saved exploration to send

Create a saved exploration which filters down to the activity you'd want to be alerted to (e.g. errors or new users added). We recommend starting with a Table visualization for alerting.

<Callout type="info">
  Add a filter for a time window that aligns with your alert frequency. For
  example, you might set a filter to `yesterday` if you want a daily alert or
  `last week` if you want a weekly alert.
</Callout>

### Setup the notification

- Click `Share` and select either `Email` or `Slack`.
- Opt for `Schedule Recurring Report`.
- Hit `Set Schedule` and match the frequency with your exploration's time window.
- Ensure `Skip Reports with Empty Data` is checked.

<Callout type="info">
  Reports are generated based on your set frequency, but only sent when relevant
  data is found, keeping you informed without cluttering your inbox or Slack.
</Callout>

</Steps>
