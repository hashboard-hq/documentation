Hello friends of Hashboard -

I hope you all have enjoyed summer and were able to spend some time away from the office! 

The team had the chance to get out of our NYC office during [our offsite](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7097562653669122049) a couple weeks ago. It was great to spend dedicated time to reflect on the work weâ€™ve accomplished and focus on where weâ€™re headed. This monthly update features a couple significant product updates that have been a long time comingâ€¦joins, a redesigned data explorer and more!

\- Carlos

PS - stay tuned for some major announcements coming next week! I canâ€™t wait to let you all in on what our team has been up to.


## JOIN us in a land of normalized data

In the past, youâ€™ve had to model data in Hashboard using flat, denormalized tables. While this can be a simple way to get started, it has its downsides. Now, you can model relational tables in Hashboard models directly.

Once you [join models](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/data-modeling/model-joins), Hashboard will automatically pull in relevant tables during queries, and allow you to use any attributes from any joined model. This gives you all the analytical flexibility of denormalized tables, and all the data tidiness of normalized data.

## Introducing the Data Tray

Weâ€™ve introduced a new approach to exploring data which makes it clear what data is available, and what actions you can take on each metric or attribute. This [new interface](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/visualizing-data/data-tray) should allow your curiosity to better guide you toward insights.

This is our first step in refining the data exploration experience to be clearer, faster, and (dare we say) fun-er.

## ðŸ“š Other Updates, Blog Posts & More

- **Aliases** - Itâ€™s now easier to reference your DataOps resources! You can assign models, saved explorations, dashboards, and color palettes their own project-wide unique aliases, which can be included anywhere youâ€™d previously [use their ID.](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/data-ops/resource-identifiers)
- **Measures** - Rename alert! You may have noticed that what used to be referenced as â€˜Metricsâ€™ in data models and the data tray, have been renamed to ['Measures.â€™](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/data-modeling/measures)
- **Saved Explorations** - Another rename and new functionality! 'Saved Views' are now ['Saved Explorations'](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/visualizing-data/explorations) to clarify what they are in Hahsboard. All exploring happens on the model now. Saved explorations are read only, but can be the start of a new exploration with the new "Explore from here" button.
- **Saving ðŸ’° with Hashboard, dbt and Git** - This [technical blog](https://hashboard.com/blog/monitoring-bigquery-costs-in-glean-with-dbt-and-github-actions) walks through an example of how our team uses Hashboard to monitor costs in our data warehouse!
