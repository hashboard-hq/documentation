# November 30th, 2023

Hello friends of Hashboard -

I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving last week for those in the U.S.! We‚Äôre wrapping up November with some powerful and highly-requested features. 

I‚Äôm particularly excited about the improvements on tables and advanced permissions! ICYMI, we recently shared an awesome example of what live data looks like in Hashboard, check out the [snow tracker here](https://hashboard.com/app/dsb/0uGUI4BUHtixsyvZ) before you hit the slopes this season ‚õ∑Ô∏è

As always, we‚Äôre grateful for your support and open to your feedback!

\- Carlos

## Resource Updates to Collaborate Easier

Three big updates have landed for project resources! You can now add a [status, label and owner](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/project-management/resource-metadata#metadata-fields) to data models, dashboards, metrics and saved explorations throughout your Hashboard project. 

We added these features to help teams better collaborate and ensure that everyone is on the same page when building or viewing resources. Say goodbye to relying on other systems or pinging your data team to confirm resource statuses.

## Role-Based Database Credentials üîê

You can now control what data users in your organization can access when viewing models, saved explorations, and dashboards built from the same data connection! 

[Role-based credentials](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/database-connections/role-based-credentials#assigning-credentials-to-roles) can be used to restrict access to certain tables, or even certain rows or columns within a table, based on a user's role. This is particularly helpful when dealing with sensitive data like PHI or PII. 

All Hashboard data connections can be optionally configured to use additional credentials which can be assigned to users on a per-role basis. Let us know if you need help getting this set up in your project!

## Custom SQL Attributes

You can now define [model attributes](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/data-modeling/attributes#custom-sql-attributes) on custom SQL statements! This allows you to filter and breakout by custom SQL snippets in addition to underlying columns.

## Table Advancements 

<img

  style={{ maxWidth: "650px" }}
/>

You can now [summarize rows and columns](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/visualizing-data/controls/table-controls#calculating-rowcolumn-summaries) into simple aggregates for more rich tables and pivots. This allows you to see both the big picture and the small details within the same table.

Tables also automatically handle nested hierarchies, displaying groups without repeated information, so you can more quickly identify what you want to find.
