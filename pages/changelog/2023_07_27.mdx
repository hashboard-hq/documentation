# July 27th, 2023

Hello friends of Hashboard -

We’re switching it up this month and sharing highlights of what our team has built over the last six months, not just in July.

Many of these features were requested or inspired by you! We ❤️ seeing all the ways teams use Hashboard to build collaborative data cultures at their orgs.

Stay tuned for some major updates coming at the end of the summer…

If you’d like a sneak peek, check out the [public roadmap](/product-roadmap) which includes dramatically improved search, joins and more!

**[Bar + Line, Multiple Axes, Trellis and More](https://docs.hashboard.com/changelog/2023_06_30#bar--line-charts-and-more)** - Choose from bars, areas and lines to layer on top of each other in the same chart. You can also display measures on different axes and scales, all from the control panel. Explore the data above yourself here!

**[Transpose Tables](https://docs.hashboard.com/changelog/2023_04_20#transpose-tables)** - The control panel is full of data viz goodies, including the toggle for transpose tables. Switch the positions of your rows and measures by switching this on.

**[Dynamic Breakouts](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/visualizing-data/breakout#dynamic-breakouts)** - This upgrade to the breakout feature makes it super easy to always look at the most relevant data. Define criteria that adapts your breakout as your data changes.

## 📚 Other Updates, Blog Posts & More

- **BI Tools Comparison** - We broke down the good, bad and ugly of BI tools on the blog. [Check out](https://hashboard.com/blog-posts/the-right-bi-tool-to-grow-a-data-driven-culture-comparing-glean-looker-metabase-and-tableau) where Hashboard shines compared to legacy tools like Looker and Tableau.
- **Row Numbers on Tables** - This one is pretty self-explanatory 🙂 every table-based visualization in Hashboard now has row numbers!
- **Pro Tip for Text Datasets** - If you’re analyzing datasets containing long blocks of text in Hashboard, you may have run into limitations. You can now double click on the cells in the underlying data view to see all of the text in a scrollable view.
- **Speed Improvements** - Exploration interactivity has been improved by ~5x! The data explorer should feel even more clicky now ⚡️
