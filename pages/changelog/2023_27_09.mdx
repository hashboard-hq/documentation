# September 27th, 2023

Hello friends of Hashboard -

What a month it’s been! In early September we officially launched as Hashboard AND released major features including advanced data search and the metrics page. 

If you’ve been a long time user of the product, thank you for your continued support! And a very warm welcome to all of the new folks that started their data exploration journeys with us this month.

Discovering insights in your data is now even easier with [Data Search!](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/visualizing-data/data-search) You can now search across all attributes and measures in your Hashboard project. Type in keywords and we’ll surface the most relevant matches.

Once you choose, either explore directly from the search results or share a link with your team. We take care of the details by filtering based on your previous selections and maintaining the relationships in your data defined by your project models.

## Metrics Page

There is now one place in Hashboard to keep your team on track with company wide metrics! 

Check out the [Metrics Page](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/metrics) in the data library on the left hand nav bar in Hashboard. Assign labels, owners and trend lines to each metric. As always you can explore and share with the click of a button.

## Sign up through the hashboard-cli

## Create CLI access keys with hb token

If you already have a Hashboard account and want to start using [hashboard-cli](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/data-ops/cli), run the following in a terminal:

pip install hashboard-cli && hb token

This will generate a new personal access key tied to your existing Hashboard project. To pull down the configuration files for resources you’ve already built in the UI, run the following:

hb pull --all

Now, you can enjoy a code-based workflow for building consistent charts. Just change these files, run hb preview and then hb deploy.

For more information, check out our [CLI Quickstart guide.](https://docs.hashboard.com/docs/data-ops/quickstart)
